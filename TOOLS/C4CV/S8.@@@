Powerful, flexible, easy to use--the Microsoft CodeView
debugger does what you want a debugger to do. And it lets
you work the way you want to work.

You can debug at the source or assembly level. Commands
can be entered with menus, function keys, a mouse, or
command lines. Multiple windows display all the information
you need when you need it. Debugging graphics programs is
a snap with the CodeView debugger.

But don't take our word for it. See for yourself.
