A common debugging technique is to establish a situation in
which you know the results your program should produce, then
see if the program actually produces those results. This
method is used in the sample session.

During the session, the debugger examines a simple program
called COUNT. This program counts the letters, words, sentences,
and other elements in a text file. The program contains a bug
that will be found and analyzed during the session.

To test the program, a text file called COUNT.TXT is provided.
The words, sentences, letters, bytes, and other elements in
COUNT.TXT have been counted by hand, and noted in the file itself.
During debugging, the numbers in the text file will be compared
to the numbers counted by the program. Any differences will
be a clue to help locate the bug.
