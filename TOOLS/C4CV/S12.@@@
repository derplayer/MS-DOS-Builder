The debugger will be started with the following command line:

	CVR /W /S /M "/C<COUNT.R" COUNT COUNT.TXT

The elements of the command line are explained below:

  - CVR is the program name of the restricted debugger.
  - /W is an option that specifies window mode.
  - /S is an option that specifies screen swapping as the
    screen-exchange mode.
  - /M is an option that turns off the mouse if you have one.
  - "/C<COUNT.R" is an option that specifies that, on start-up,
    commands will be redirected from COUNT.R to the debugger.
  - COUNT is the executable file (the .EXE extension is assumed).
  - COUNT.TXT is the file to be processed by COUNT.EXE.

Your command line may also include the /B, /I, or /D options,
depending on selections made at previous menus. See the
CODEVIEW.DOC file for more information on command lines.

The debugger will now be started. Loading and initial processing
may take a moment . . .
