  COUNT is a simple program for analyzing text files.  It makes 
certain reasonable assumptions that will be valid for most text files.  
For example, it assumes that terminating punctuation (period, question 
mark, or exclamation point) marks the end of a sentence.  COUNT will 
produce incorrect results on files that contain abbreviations, dot 
codes, or other uses of terminating punctuation.  The program uses a 
constant for the number of vowels per syllable.  This number is based 
on analysis of several typical files.  Finally, Y is assumed to be a 
consonant at the start of a word, but a vowel within a word.  

  During the session you'll need to know that this file contains 796 
bytes, 630 characters, 588 letters, 226 vowels, 127 words, 13 lines, 
and 8 sentences.
