There is a bug in IBM PC-DOS 3.20 which may cause improper operation of a
program if a floating point exception is generated.  This patch to IBM
PC-DOS 3.20 is provided to insure proper operation of programs which may
generate floating point exceptions.  In particular, the C runtime routine
signal with the SIGFPE parameter does not work with the unpatched version
of IBM PC-DOS 3.20.  IBM has also made a patch for this problem available.

Procedure for patching IBM PC-DOS 3.20:

1.	Use the DOS sys command to transfer IBMDOS.COM and IBMBIO.COM
	to a writable diskette.

2.	Copy command.com, sys.com and debug.com from your IBM DOS 3.20 
	diskette to the new diskette.  

3.	Copy stkpat.bat, stkpat.scr, rmrhs.exe and setrhs.exe from the 
	\patch directory to the new diskette.  

4.	Reboot the system from the new diskette.

5. 	Run stkpat.bat.  This patches the IBMBIO.COM on the new diskette.

6.	Use the DOS sys command to transfer the patch to any other 
	IBM PC-DOS 3.20 diskette.

If you are running any version of DOS 3.20 other than IBM PC-DOS 3.20, contact
your hardware manufacturer (OEM) to find out if the problem exists in your 
DOS 3.20 version.
